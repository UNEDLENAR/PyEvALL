# PyEvALL
 PyEvALL (The Python library to Evaluate ALL) is an evaluation tool for information systems that allows assessing a wide range of metrics covering various evaluation contexts, including classification, ranking, or LeWiDi (Learning with disagreement). PyEvALL is designed based on the following concepts: (i) **persistence**, users can save evaluations and retrieve past evaluations; (ii) **replicability**, all evaluations are conducted using the same methodology, making them strictly comparable; (iii) **effectiveness**, all metrics are unified under measurement theory and have been doubly implemented and compared; (iv) **generalization**, achieved through the use of a standardized input format enabling users to evaluate all evaluation contexts.
