PyEvALL is designed based on the following concepts: (i) **persistence**, users can save evaluations and retrieve past evaluations; (ii) **replicability**, all evaluations are conducted using the same methodology, making them strictly comparable; (iii) **effectiveness**, all metrics are unified under measurement theory and have been doubly implemented and compared; (iv) **generalization**, achieved through the use of a standardized input format enabling users to evaluate all evaluation contexts.\n""",
